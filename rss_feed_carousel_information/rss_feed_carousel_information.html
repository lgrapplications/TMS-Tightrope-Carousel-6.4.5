	<h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Written by: Larry Robertson on December 17, 2017</p>
    <p>This document contains links to the information gathered by me to supplement any existing information or documentation provided by Tightrope Media Systems as related to the Tightrope Carousel version 6.4.5.</p>
    <p>The information herein is provided as is and may or may not be 100% accurate for any version of Carousel. This is my best attempt to backwards engineer the TMS RSS Feed Implementation. Within this document I will provide links to download the RSS 2.0 XSD Schema for Carousel that I wrote based on this backwards engineering as well as demo bulletins.</p>

	<h3>The Three Most Common Errors in Carousel When Creating RSS Feeds</h3>
    <ol>
    	<li>Cause: RSS Feed File not Found on Server. Carosel reports error as: The supplied syndication resource has a content format of None, which does not match the expected content format of Rss.</li>
    	<li>Cause: One or more Blocks are overlaping one another. Carosel reports error as: Error: No blocks could fit on the current template.</li>
    	<li>Cause: Either the channel image url is invalid or the item enclosure url attribute value is invalid. Carosel reports error as: Error: Please contact Administrator's Name for assistance.</li>
