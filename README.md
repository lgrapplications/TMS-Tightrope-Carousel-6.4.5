# TMS Tightrope Carousel Information Related to the YouTube Tutorial
> Overview
Written by: Larry Robertson on December 17, 2017.
This document contains information gathered by me to supplement any existing information or documentation provided by Tightrope Media Systems as related to the Tightrope Carousel version 6.4.5.
The information herein is provided as is and may or may not be 100% accurate for any version of Carousel. This is my best attempt to backwards engineer the TMS RSS Feed Implementation and provide an RSS 2.0 Schema specifically geared to TMS Tightrope Carousel Version 6.4.5.  
1. Download the zip file which contains Schemas, RSS test instances and images needed to reproduce the Television Bulletins shown in the YouTube Tutorial by Larry Robertson. Click the green button "Clone or Download" and in the dropdown select "Download Zip".
2. Unzip the file and put on your web server in an appropriate folder so that the RSS Feeds and resources will be avalable to Carousel.
