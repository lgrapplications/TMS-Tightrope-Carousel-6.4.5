> Overview
Written by: Larry Robertson on December 17, 2017.
This document contains information gathered by me to supplement any existing information or documentation provided by Tightrope Media Systems as related to the Tightrope Carousel version 6.4.5.
The information herein is provided as is and may or may not be 100% accurate for any version of Carousel. This is my best attempt to backwards engineer the TMS RSS Feed Implementation. Within this document I will provide links to downlod the RSS 2.0 XSD Schema for Carousel that I wrote based on this backwards engineering.
